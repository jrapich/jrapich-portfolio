# Jeremy Rapich Porfolio

## Description

This project was the first real challenge of my coding boot camp and career, really. I spent an insane amount of time
relative to how much content there actually is, or even worse, how it looks! At first I had to test the CSS almost 
line by line because I had no idea really of what I was doing or what all the stuff means.

I built this project because I wanted to know how to build something from stratch for the first time and integrate it all
together. I was curious of how the CSS stuff would work in practice in a real life scenario, and oh man I was quite overwhelmed at first.

I learned that .... I have so much more to learn! Ultimately this was stressful and difficult trying to peice this together.
I do feel that I now have a better understanding of how CSS works, and I think that if I had to do something like this again
starting from scratch, that it will probably go a lot faster now that I actually have an idea of what CSS is doing.
CSS is difficult for me as it is quite visual, and it required me testing and retesting and experimenting almost every single step 
of the way to identify what was or was not working.

I ultimately feel like this has met the assignment requirements, but I personally feel like it looks ugly and there are probably several things i could do to make it more efficient and creative code wise. It for sure has more potential to look and function so much better, as I learn more through this class. This will definitly be something I revisit in the future as I get more knowledge, as I would love to maintain this and keep it up to date and sleek for when I eventually send it to any potential future employers.

## Credits

I used several websites to help me better understand what I was doing on several concepts.

flex box froggy helped me visually understand what was happening regarding flexboxes:
https://www.flexboxfroggy.com

Some advice that helped me determine how to make the images of my cards go blurry when under mouse hover:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31522847/how-to-blur-background-image-on-hover-but-not-the-text?rq=3
I was trying to get the floating text above the main box not go blurry, just the picture, but I didn't include it 
into the final product(yet!!) because I was spending way too much time trying to figure out something that wasn't necessarry
to complete the project. I'll finish this at a later date.

I followed this documentation to set up a striped color background with linear-gradient:

Also big shoutout to fellow bootcamp students Brian Whisler and P.J. Kaeyln Rasmussen. Their insights and advice helped me figure out a few things regarding flexbox and CSS in general during a study group session.
